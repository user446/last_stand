Simple DOTS test

Features and trade-offs:
- No composition root
- ScriptableObjects-based approach to game settings
- All UI is managed within systems
- Simple namespace structure
- Usage of ECB and Burst wherever possibe
- Custom jobs are avoided altogether, Entities.ForEach used instead
- Some hacks here and there
- UIDocument as singleton both as entity and as mb
- DOTS 1.3
- Very nice
